# DarkDetect

DarkDetect is a Python-based project designed to analyze images for deceptive and manipulative content and determine whether they have been tampered with. It provides a robust solution for identifying potentially misleading visual content, which can be crucial in various contexts such as journalism, forensics, and social media monitoring.

## Features

- **Deceptive Content Analysis**: DarkDetect employs advanced image processing techniques to identify deceptive or manipulative elements within images.
  
- **Tampering Detection**: The project utilizes algorithms to detect signs of image tampering, ensuring the integrity of the visual data.

- **Confidence Scoring**: DarkDetect provides a confidence score indicating the likelihood of deceptive content or image tampering.

- **Tips and Recommendations**: In addition to analysis results, DarkDetect offers insights and recommendations on how to interpret the findings and handle potentially problematic images.
